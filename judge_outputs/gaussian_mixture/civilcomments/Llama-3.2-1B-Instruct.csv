Your frustration is understandable.  Once the fallacies of antifluoridationist arguments have been fully exposed and refuted with facts and evidence, they frequently become frustrated and resort to childish rants and personal attacks such as you have here.

You completely disrespect the intelligence of the citizens of your community if you believe they will accord credence to misinformation simply because it is presented by one who claims to be a member of the community, while discarding valid facts and evidence simply because they are presented by one whom does not reside in the community.

Therefore the child does not deserve to die for something he/she had nothing to do with.  Incest does not justify murder.  The health of the mother does not justify murder.  Doctors should do all they can to save both.

Teachers date the behaviors and are very specific in their descriptions of the behavior and the environment in which it occurred.   For example, one incident may get the teachers attention, but multiple repetitions of the same or similar incident show a pattern that may be of concern and require remediation, additional staff, parent involvement, etc.  

In regard to concerns about an administrator, it is just as important to document specific behaviors.

Estimating the cost 10 years ago the factors have risen tremendously. 
10 years from now the same will happen.

"Illegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level.  The annual outlay that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers is an average amount per native-headed household of $1,117.

  Education for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion.

  At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal aliens. At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs associated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens.

Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns. Many are also claiming tax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. Treasury.

"That's patently false -- the economy has declined since Trump, with growth at 1.2%. Also, he has created less than a million jobs since taking office... and many of the jobs from Q1 can be credited under Obama's watch. This will not help the U.S. economically in the long-term, as it is projected we will be slapped with billions of dollars in carbon tariffs by the rest of the world's participants. Also, the money going into the Green Fund would allow developing nations to purchase the tech & infrastructure for greener economies... and those purchases would have been made from developed nations (i.e. the U.S.). China and India are set to meet their reductions years before the deadline, which the U.S. will not, especially after Trump's ridiculous roll-backs in fuel emissions for cars, etc. And the Green Fund has already raised billions, despite Trump's lies that only U.S. contributed, mostly from the private sector.",0,"7

If accelerating the Islamification of Canada is in our interests, we should do it. If it is not not, we should not.

Canada is on track to be a Muslim majority nation by 2080. Go ahead and do the math based on a current Muslim population of 1.2 million, and use annual percentage growth rates of 8%, decreasing by 1 point every 10 years through 2080. Currently the Muslim population is increasing by just over 9% per year by the way, so the 8% number is not fictional.

And if your argument is that those Muslims will secularize, joining the trend in the rest of the populace, provide evidence of that.

You don't hear much about that these days because Hitler invaded Ukraine when he broke the pact and the Russians stood their ground.

What we do know is this: the difference between the number of beds available with and without the levy is small. That small number of criminals cannot logically be responsible for all or even most of the crime perpetrated in our community. So, we would be paying a large amount for, at most, a small reduction in crime.

Furthermore, the mayor should not be able to appoint members to the commission.  The mayor as the Chief Executive is the measuring rod for everything that the executive branch does and fails to do.

"Before reading this post, I read the post with the theme that God's ways are not our ways.  Jesus was going to be killed, and he stopped Peter's attempts to change that.

I think Benedict's forced resignation and placing Francis as Pope was the sort of act that Jesus spoke against to Peter.  So the problematic acts of Francis are just the fruit of the initial bad act of driving Benedict out (likely by the homosexual mafia that apparently has great power and is using communion for divorced Catholics as a wedge to allow communion without repentance for homosexuals who commit sinful sex acts).

But, alas, I think we just have to sit back and let it all happen.  Perhaps the destruction of the Church through the infiltration of Satan is precisely God's plan.  The question is whether we should follow the fake Pope or reject him.",1,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

I understand the need to offer compassion and support to these kinds of people, and see good in doing just that.

"If you have any stock investments, check out your annual reports. Up to half of the report typically is devoted to some convoluted wage comparisons that ""prove"" that the CEO's and top executives' executive pay is ""fair"" via comparing them to what other CEO's and top executives make in 'similar' companies. 

Of course it is a bit of a closed loop as no company wants to suggest 'their' executives are such poor performers that they ought to be relegated to the bottom fifth of pay. And, of course, the Board of Directors who approve these salaries are drawn from the same strata. 

So the party goes on, and undoubtedly filters into academia (note that 500K would be almost a poverty wage in most major private corporations).

"To all of you idiots comparing Lee with Hitler, etc.  That's ridiculous.  Hitler was evil, killing non combatants and trying to wipe out a people.  I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?

After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.

"Muslims from certain countries should be excluded temporarily, until the United States conduct reasonably sufficient vetting, because as a group, terrorists pose an existential threat to the United States, and almost all major acts of terrorism perpetrated throughout the world for the past 20 years have been by Muslim extremists.  The Quran is read by too many Muslims to sanction the killing of infidels, simply because they are infidels.  There you have the making of another American disaster.  Now, if the chances of terrorists' entering the country were small, or if the size of the harm they pose were small, there would be a good argument that NO special vetting is needed.  But no other population has, in recent times, had so many practitioners of both frequent and huge-scale violence.  So long as there are so many Muslims committing so many acts of terror in the name of Islam, we are rational in at least taking special care to see that those who come aren't a real risk.",1,"8

"I agree. That man is focused solely on himself as President of the USA and Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces, and thereby, ex officio CEO of the world. He should  be a side issue. But as long as he occupies the office of President, he will continue blindsiding his Administration, Congress and the judiciary. His ""executive orders"" will continue undermining the already teetering state of global politics. 
All parties should be focused on preserving our national family, promoting global peace and justice, and addressing crucial environmental issues. As long as that man remains in the White House, there is no telling what he will do next. Making his term of office as brief as possible would be not only in the best interest of our national and global futures, it would also be the best way to save him from himself.

While he is a born rich billionaire who had everything handed to him, he does use the truth to get ahead, something this article does well pointing out.
The W. Bush war is a war that qualifies as a war crime, and the fact that the Republican Party delighted in laws that hastened the movement of American manufacturing to Asia and Mexico is obvious and the factor that is the most at fault for the plight of those voting for Trump. The Republican Party is led by an elitist super rich cartel. 

I actually can see a path to the office for Trump, but it would take riots in the Southwest, ala Nixon standing on the hood of a car getting protesters to riot, it would take a major assault on American territory by Islamic terrorists, ala 911, and it would take a major downturn in the economy.

"Dave Phil, Eastern Orthodox liturgical practice and theology is almost entirely unchanged since before the schism of 1054. Since prior to that date, the East and West were fully united in one Great Church (as it is sometimes called), and since in the Great Church there was mutual acceptance of one anothers difference practices and theologies, those divergent practices and theologies are completely within the Catholic Tradition. Therefore, it is very sound theological practice to look to the East an to those divergences when trying to more deeply understand the Western strand of the same broad Tradition. 

We saw that phenomenon in practice during the last two synods on the family. The liberal wing in that synod very much wanted to import theological understanding from the East as a foundation for the merciful pastoral practice Pope Francis wanted to introduce. Sadly, only a simple majority was with him, not the requisite 2/3's.

In addition, most of the standard Republicans named are atrocious - anyone associated with the last Bush administration, the worst government in modern US history (until, quite probably, Trump) should be persona non grata. But that underlines a critical point: a huge part of the problem in the US is that the Republican Party is simply unfit to govern. The only thing it believes in is small government and low taxes. Since all the problems the US faces require higher taxes and more involved government, Trump (and the GOP in general) are doomed to fail - assuming, of course, that governing for the public good is even of concern to them.

The children need to be taken from that toxic environment - the family lied when petitioning for custody and did not disclose that the father murdered the mother and they tried to refuse visitation by the aunt.  And by the sounds of it, they are okay with what the father did, he is allowed to be a part of the kids lives and has free access to them.   This sounds like pure evil, straight up.  I can't believe people are defending them.  If the kids get stuck there, they will grow up believing that it was okay for their father to kill their mother.   That she deserved to die.

There are a lot of decent priests who labor under the burden of the few and those who protect them. I can think of several priests who have retired at the first possible moment because of this burden. The Church will respond to civil government addressing the problem, first with wringing of the hands decrying persecution, but later facing the facts.

It also wasn't a surprise that the Anti-Trump media over reacted to the Dreamers Decision, after all they have been in attack mode for months waiting to pounce on any misstatement or action. Their hostility has seriously impaired their judgement.

In my Opinion the Dreamers aren't going anywhere, Trump cant deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants from the states, so his best option is to tie financing for the border wall to the DACA legislation. The Democrats have to realize that it's in their best interest to work with Trump rather than force him to bow to the radical right wing of the Republican party and that Trump would have never made this move if there was any chance of impeachment from the Russian investigation. Trump isn't stupid or evil, if Americans give him a chance he could be the most productive president in a generation.",0,"7

North Korea attached preconditions to its proposal to talk with the U.S.  The U.S. replied that North Korea must first take concrete steps to show its sincerity in giving up its nuclear weapons.  That was not a precondition – it was a demand that North Korea live up to previous agreements and United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear and missiles, which NK has not done.

My assumption is there is some number you are looking for that will swing your vote one way or the other.

Maybe this thought can help.  It isn't how many total companies but how many WILL pass the tax on to the poor thru lower middle class.  The poor won't or can't buy I-pads (optional for the more well to do.) and things like that  But the poor have to buy gas, food, and insurance.  They also have to pay utility bills.  I'm sure PacifiCorp (electricity), Portland General Electric, NW Natural Gas, CenturyLink, and all cell phone providers, et al. will easily pass the minimum threshold for the tax to kick in.  My guess is most public utilities like EWEB and SUB will also hit the minimum threshold.  These companies will all easily pass the tax on.  Does this help?",0,"4

He buys companies with a Net Operating Loss Carryforward to offset the earnings of the companies he already owns to eliminate their taxes.

"Be very careful before getting too excited about some of the dividend yields here.

For example, ARLP is a U.S. MLP (Master Limited Partnership) and as such it pays distributions, not dividends and these distributions are distributions of partnership income. As such the withholding tax is at the highest U.S. corporate marginal tax rate (35% currently, I believe) and this withholding applies and is irrecoverable for units held in a registered retirement plan (and in a TFSA and RESP).

But an even bigger reason why Canadian investors should not touch these entities with a ten foot pole is that the IRS deems holders of MLP units to be conducting business in the U.S. and therefore holders are required to file a U.S. tax return with the IRS. Trust me, this is an absolute nightmare.

I agree on the points made in the article for the most part. The attempt by the Government to encourage the adoption of ZEV's is admirable but the approach is wrong. The expansion of the rebate of 14K to cars over 70G (which now includes the high end luxury Teslas) is shortsighted. They should use every dollar they can spare for the cause of  building or subsidizing the charging networks. It is my belief that the ZEV cars will be cheap enough to compete against the ICE cars in 3 to 4 years. Some cars at the lower end with a lower rebate to match the ICE prices might help adoption rather then the wasting the money on the 100K car where the buyers does not need the rebate.,0,"4

You even went the extra step of finding a babysitter so you SIL doesn't have to. Your SIL should have realized by now that adult receptions are hard on small children, and small children at receptions can be hard on adults trying to celebrate adult events. If you give in because your SIL is throwing a tantrum worthy of one of her small children, you will begin your marriage by establishing that she can throw a fit and get her way. If she is the only one allowed to bring small children, everyone else will wonder why THEY had to leave THEIRS at home.

You hearing things?

I guess so.

I already told you there are enough 'metrics' to conclude that Trump cannot be normalized.

You wish to normalize that which is not able to be normalized, 

and you wish to attempt to do so by pretending to wrap it up as some intellectual exercise.

By any metric, Trump is a con man and a buffoon.

He has a decades long history cementing that assessment.

"There are some articles written by attorneys or based on attorney's comments that say that the language of the contract is not as broad as believed. For example, it talks about barring people from boarding. And it talks about flights oversold or overbooked but not about airline employees who are simply boarding and being added to the passenger list when they show up. It appears from the language that the airline's right extends only to stopping ticketed passengers from boarding. This means that they do not have a legal right to physically assault them or drag them off the plane to get them out of their seat and out of the plane. And the Airline does not have right to retain agents like the police or airport security to remove passengers when they have no right to assault or legally kidnap them (kidnap in the legal sense).",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

There are built-in boundaries in the Constitution in the form of checks and balances and separation of powers. How those are lived out in every age is the ongoing work of democracy. I'm not in agreement with the notion that government can fix every societal problem, but I do believe in robust debate about how government can best serve us in the here and now.

Why?

Because eventually, a DNC member will apologize that they did not understand that they were hitting the 'send'  button rather than the 'delete'  button.

The only person, and I mean the ONLY person that is less trustworthy than Hillary Clinton is the leader of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has rigged the election from the Democrat side from the beginning.

Think I am wrong, liberals?

Just wait.

So. That said.

I, for one, do not trust for a second that this was a breach that was taken by the Russians, but was instead, given unto them.

Why do I believe this?

Because personal information was not taken from any other part of the site.

ONLY the complete Donald Trump information was taken.

I really wonder why this is.

Yeah, yeah, detractors will state that Trumps website and the RNC's website were attacked as well.

This will filter down to parishes where some priests will ignore the Episcopal guidelines and do their own thing one way or another. According to the doctrine of Primacy of Conscience no pope or bishop can oblige a priest or anyone to act against his conscience and do what he considers to be evil. I believe that this was St Thomas's original concept on this question. Therefore, no priest can be obliged by his bishop to give Communion to those whom he considers in conscience to be living in an adulterous relationship if he believes it would be sinful for him to do so. Current interpretation of Primacy of Conscience can work both ways.

And that employer being able to discipline those employees if they defy that job requirement.  They have just as much a right to do that, should they choose to exercise it.

One thing not mentioned is related to the fact that rental stuff is often crap. Rather than buy a circular saw for a small project a few years ago, I rented. The saw was so poorly maintained it wouldn't cut straight. So I returned it and got another. Same problem. All I got was a shrug from the rental company. If I had bought the saw it would have done the job easily and properly.

Now I suppose if rental were the norm, as in short term car rental, that might change. But the rental business is also sometimes a license for rip-off. For example. you can't convince me that leasing a car long term is anywhere near as advantageous as outright ownership.

Theft was what the oil companies were doing when they sent the profits out of the country. See, ""neo-colonialism"". Chavez called his movement, the ""Bolivarian Revolution"" because, as did Bolivar in the 19th century,  it threw off the hold European companies had over Venezuela's natural resources and economy.",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

They should also consider that they have a duty to help business maintain their security, and if network services, encryption protocols, or implementations are compromised, even when intended just for ""lawful authority,"" the history seems to suggest outside others will frequently discover and exploit it, creating opportunity for crime where none should exist. For a network security professional, it's degrading. For a consumer, it's potentially disastrous.

"You, the professor and I agree about Gautrain - it doesn't meet the criteria of a mass public transport system - accessible to and used by large numbers of users, relatively cheap cf other forms of transport, etc.
I've never used Uber but UberX is about R7.50/km Jo'burg (CT R7), below metered taxis but above minibus rates. Uber is NOT mass transport - your (and Ivo's) definition of mass public transport is way off.
About public goods, one would think taxpayers and governments would gladly pay for it but like most items we have alternatives for, eg private transport that has numerous benefits over public, it's a grudge expense. Would we object to, say, expensive desalination plants w/ climate change (that Ivo disputes) upon us causing long-term drought and dams empty? (Well, ok, we might.)

  Additionally, I feel that if he was intentionally breaking the rules and hoping that he wouldn't be caught, the easiest, smoothest way to duck the blame would have been to say something to the effect of ""Oh, hey, I guess it turns out my wife/handlers DID give some pain meds to the dogs after they made it to Nome while I was sleeping.

"Raven,

I think part of the problem here is that there are two aspects: criminal, which belongs to the police and professionals, and student safety, which belongs to the university.

Stanford cannot conduct a criminal investigation and should not pretend to.

Stanford is, however, responsible for ensuring student safety and when a student is accused of sexually assaulting another student, Stanford should investigate and take appropriate action.  

In this case, the evidence was reviewed twice and both times, the majority of the reviewers concluded that  student A sexually assaulted student B.  Stanford's response - using procedural niceties to justify doing nothing.

Step away from courts and colleges. If a BP employee told HR that another employee raped them while they were working on the slope and two separate internal reviews supported their story, how long do you think it would take BP to fire the alleged rapist? 

Is Stanford's situation really any different?",0,"8

Obviously you've tried to tell management that your manager isn't very good. And what happens? Well, a little bit of pussy-footing. And your manager briefly changes her behavior and then goes back to her old ways. 

Management usually is loathed to look over a manager's shoulder. So things have to get pretty bad before they decide, ""It's the coach, not the players"". 

And this might be a bit of the ""Un-fireable Employee"" syndrome where, despite all evidence to the contrary, they will be the last one given the boot. (I have no idea how anyone gets to this exulted state, but it happens.)

Of course the latter was gutted by years of neglect under the rule of Moscow's satrap in Kyiv, Yanukovych - but that is changing. While I don't disagree that the Russian Federation (sic) could occupy all/most of Ukraine if it wanted to wage an all-out war it would find itself choking on a very hard candy, for Ukrainians have a long (and proud) history of resisting Russian/Soviet imperialism.

Income, sales...take your pick.  Not because we like handing money over to the government - but because we don't!  

One of the reasons we're in the pickle we're in is apathy.  We didn't have to contribute anything and got money handed to us for doing nothing but breathing.  So why pay attention to what the politicians were up to?  If anyone thinks all of the corrupt bastards were rooted out by the VECO scandal, they're dreaming.  SB-21 should have made that clear.

Lower tax rates, particularly on labor and capital, lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth. 

The Reagan tax cuts reduced rates for all income classes, especially the low and middle income earner. Reducing the high marginal rates (up to 70% on high-income earners) causes little, if any, revenue loss, because of the large, positive supply-side effects.  by the time President Reagan left office, the economy was generating more tax revenue at a maximum 28% rate than many on the left forecast it to generate at a maximum 70% rate.

"I'm not convinced buybacks are a great idea.  I remember banks and lifeco's issuing shares in 2008/9 at prices far below what they had been buying back a year or two earlier.  My bigger concern is the impact it has on executive compensation.  As share prices rise, because of the buybacks, the exec's win for basically doing nothing but ride the wave.  Also targets such as EPS become easier to hit, without improving the business.  Fewer shares on the same income equals higher EPS.  If the company has money they don't have a solid plan for, issue a special dividend.  No boost in exec. comp, nor option values so not something a CEO or Chair would be keen to endorse.  But I ask whose interest do they really have at heart?",0,"4

"10% of society has had gay sex.  Full time gays may be 3% or it may be more.  Asexuals are 1% or 2%.  Heteros largely left the priesthood when Paul liberalized exit and the fear of discipline ended with Vatican II.  The population sizes are close enough to make it reasonable that half the remaining priests are gay (and some of my priest friends will tell you how gay) while the other half is likely asexual (with many of the gay priests towing the asexual line).  I won't call asexuals an aberration, but I will insist that they quit monopolizing the Magisterium about sex.  The first step is that they find some degree of self-realization followed by public disclosure and a reworking of the doctrine they assumed to be universal, when it is only a sexual peculiarity.",1,4,4,0,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture
"If the railroad in Alaska had been built according to the rules that most roadbuilders follow (especially when burning through government funds, to selected winning bids) then we'd see dozens of railroads... 

The subsidy of duplication and maintenance for regular highways, sees more waste due to the fact most people do not use trains.

And perhaps they should. 

Especially along Turnagain Arm where individual judgement is clouded by racecar driver (stoplight-to-stoplight) is apparent. If you try to drive conditions, or under a posted limit, you are a moving roadblock. Some places do need more funding to be safer. 

Railroads can move tons for a few cents a mile. +So many texters could sit & not drive.

"I find it really odd that some companies still try to pretend they have the upper hand when the economy is doing well. I have no idea why they behave like this. I suspect that because the industry overall is driven for whatever reason toward younger people - and try to drive out older workers - that they have almost no memory. Certainly no concept that the people they are dealing with tend to be incredibly intelligent, and tend to network with others, and will tell people to steer clear of certain companies that don't project the right attitudes.


In other words, the evaluation done during an ""interview"" is a TWO WAY street, not one way. Companies that think they are there to interrogate a subject to see if they will sing and dance just so are doing it wrong.

"""Using prayer as a tool of coercion is an ugly process in any forum. sigh....""

This is an excellent evaluation and comment about the whole situation. It is assumed that if ""we prayed about it, we must be making the right decision.""

And this theory is spiritual hog wash. The early church no doubt prayed considerable before changing the day of worship to Sunday, and no doubt used this argument to affirm their decision must necessarily be right.

And this is the basic spirituality of Rome. Namely, The Holy Spirit will not let us make a faulty decision and thus our church decisions are infallible. From there is is ""unity and surrender to church authority, or death.""

In fact, they claim they did not change the day, Christ did, and they only carry out the will of Christ. So they did change the day, but only under the authority of Christ and the Holy Spirit.

Why won't people acknowledge that the 40 YEAR old Hyde Amendment prevents the use of federal funds for elective abortions?

All this does is take away funding for contraception, pap smears, STD testing, breast exams and medically accurate sex education!  How is that ""prolife""?  

Where are the corresponding bills for paid family leave,  medical assistance, and food stamps?  Nowhere.",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

"The Star Spangled Banner is about the flag but it was about the flag in the war of 1812, when the English tried to take back 'their colonies', for the second time. It only had 15 stars then. The Star Spangled Banner is worthy of the National Anthem because it is about the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the English, and how the fort and flag 'came through the night'.  This football player is getting the National Anthem confused with the Pledge of Allegiance, and they are totally different. The Pledge of Allegiance was a clergy man marketer that developed a scheme of introducing it into the public schools as a way to sell flags. The 'under god' part was stuck in by Eisenhower as a propaganda tool during the Cold War. The original Pledge of Allegiance, forced on school children, should be protested. The original Pledge was to stand, with right arm stretched rigid, palm flat down and pointing to the flag. http://www.nww2m.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pledge2.jpg",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

"""Convicted terrorist-turned-Women's March organizer Rasmea Odeh has been deported from the United States to Jordan after it was revealed that she lied on her application for a U.S. visa and for U.S. citizenship. Odeh did not state on her application that she was convicted in 1970 for two bombings in Jerusalem that resulted in the deaths of two people, and hence was tried for immigration fraud. After several appeals and a vacated sentence, on March 23, 2017 Odeh was sentenced to be deported and to be stripped of her U.S. citizenship. Her citizenship was formally revoked on August 17.  Odeh was one of the co-authors of the Women's March's 'A Day Without A Woman' planned strike and was active in the Women's March activism.""

"Gail Boerwinkle - What most people don't understand is that the ""independent"" ethics committee - created solely by a party-line vote by the Democrats in 2008 (when they controlled all branches of gov't) - requires reform because it allows for unconstitutional accusations by anonymous informants. The 6th amendment outlines many of the rights of criminal defendants, including the right to confront your accuser and cross-examine them. Three Congressmen have been sent to jail by this body operating in this unconstitutional manner.

You may think it's ""weakening"" ethics investigations, but I ask you, would you like to stand a felony trial with no right to cross-examine your accuser? Maybe you'd like to be hanged out back without even a trial. That is essentially what happens in this ""independent"" (read Democratic Party controlled) ethics committee.

That needs to change so that it's fairly based on constitutional guidelines.",0,"8

I rarely reply to others. I have my say and let everyone have their say. Sites which host are not used to argue, most sites ask user to not do that. Also, it's a waste of limited bandwidth.  
However I will respond. The church was aligned with Hitler. Thus it made it much easier for Hitler (Shicklegruber a Catholic) to begin and wage WWII. Hitler did huge amounts of war-death-kill, as the GOP. 
The church was aligned with Hitler before during and even after WWI. The church provided a hiding place, food, medical attention and passport papers for them. 
In return for it's alignment the church got to attack Jews, Communists, Socialists and unions. 
As we see the church can no longer raise armies or conduct hundreds or thousands of inquisitions ( Spanish, Roman and in every town and village throughout Europe.
Now the church is tightly aligned with the Repubs to the destruction of America, the ME and throughout much of the world.

Democracy has no answer for that kind of situation and therefore all tools politicians have will not help resolve that.

Fundamentally new thinking is needed if they ever want to live in peace.

Democracy means ruling of majority and respect to minority.

“Mandatory celibacy” is an oxymoron. Rightly understood, celibacy “for the sake of the kingdom” is a charism -- a gift, a calling -- in its own right. In scripture, it arises in the context of the expectation that the Second Coming of the Lord was imminent. There is no biblical warrant for linking it to ministry, still less for making it a requirement for ministry. Celibacy, like marriage, must be freely accepted as a vocation in its own right; it cannot (or ought not, anyway) be asserted as a condition for something else. Mandatory celibacy makes as much (and as little) sense as mandatory marriage. If a person is truly called to celibacy, that person will live a celibate life apart from whatever work he does -- he (or she) would live in celibacy apart from whether or not he (or she) was also called to priesthood.",0,"4

"I know this was from a few days ago, but I was out of town.  

The fact is, is that trying to get a Death conviction just by itself, usually costs millions.  Add on to that that one is not allowed to just plead guilty to the Death Penalty, so there would have to be a trial.  After that there are mandatory appeals and a whole process that they will need to go to which can take years, even if the defendant wants to die.

On average, it costs about $31k/year to house an inmate.  At 19, lets assume he lives until he is 80, that would cost the tax payers a little under $2million for over 60 years of incarceration.  A number EASILY reached by most Death Penalty trials.

So, your notion that ""libs like spending other peoples money"" is a little off the mark as your suggestion of going for the DP would be MORE costly.  But, its not that surprising as most conservatives that are for the DP know very little about its reality and are often unaware of their own conflicting views.",0,"4

Yet something on this Hamilton team has changed over the past two weeks since June Jones and Jeremiah Masoli took the reins.

Over their previous two games, the Ticats have run the ball better, turned the ball over less and taken fewer penalties. That’s helped them scratch out a pair of much-needed victories in late-game situations against the two best teams in the East...

I agree, Sweden is definitely moving in the right direction.  From the Forbes article:

""One country headed in the opposite direction is Sweden, which moves up four spots to the top of the charts for the first time (Sweden ranked No. 17 in 2006). Over the past two decades the country has undergone a transformation built on deregulation and budget self-restraint with cuts to Sweden’s welfare state.

Sweden’s government shrank jobless and disability benefits to encourage employment. The lower benefits allowed for tax cuts. The inheritance tax was scrapped in 2005 and the wealth tax was canned two years later. A new bill lowered the energy tax on data centers by 97% effective Jan. 1.""

It took a person about one hour of using Google to discover the sexual abuse finding in Washington but it just is NOT anything covered by the state background test.

Obama told Medvedev it was important for incoming President Vladimir Putin to ""give me space"" on missile defense and other difficult issues and that after the 2012 presidential election he would have ""more flexibility."" Medvedev said he would ""transmit"" the message to Putin",0,"8

Some hate him because of smugness - they think they are inherently better than Trump. But some Canadians are smart enough to know that the reason they hate Trump is that he personifies the major short comings and weaknesses of Trudeau's liberalism. We hate him because deep down inside, while we know we couldn't vote for him, we know he is right about certain things.

Religion: There is no way on earth O'Leary is going to be able to pander to the Reform Party roots within the CPC.   His religion is greed, and there are thousands of clips of him saying things to this effect.

Success:  While Trump critics decry his bankruptcies and business failures, he does still own a vast empire of hotels and has his name on many more, along with golf courses.  Trump's wealth is real.  O'Leary, on the other hand would be easily discredited as a phony ""rich guy"".  Trump wasn't stupid enough to launch a mutual fund company that has done little to make money.

I don't want to see anyone destroyed by false accusations. The accuser needs some kind of sanction imposed for making a false accusation. They shouldn't be able to accuse and then run off, as so many of the Trump accusers did do last year.  He stood his ground and no one got paid off as I've heard some liberals claim. I think it was the opposite, they were paid to pop up. There was such a bad smell to it. They all came out 'as if on cue' right after the Billy Bush tape. The media reports everything, compounding the destruction of a person's reputation, that condemns the person as guilty before any facts even surface.  I don't think accusations against anyone  should ever be reported on the 'news' until more is known.",0,"5

If not, there can be no expectation of reciprocity.  Alternatively, if a woman in the American contingent CHOSE to wear a head covering, I don't think I'd have any sort of huge problem with that either.  The choice to show respect should likewise be respected.  What would be very, very impressive to me, is if the American men donned traditionally female Saudi head dresses and walked the mile in others' shoes.

"""...but now that Donald Trump is President the genre is essential, excoriating viewing"".
---------------------------
Just why is it essential viewing? I know Trump is an unbearable idiot so why would I need to watch a show mocking him? And to be perfectly honest, what sort of person derives their political information and opinion from a comedy show. 

In a recent article, the son of Neil Postman wrote a column suggesting his father's polemic, ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"", predicted the rise of a figure like Donald Trump. 
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-fixed-target-of-a-trump-administration-has-tv-satire-soaring/article33910624/comments/

But there is the flip side of Postman's prescient warning: those trapped in a television existence in which comedy becomes knowledge and the act of laughing at satire as protest - or worse - conceived as political action.",1,4,4,0,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

That would mean that the woman at the very least had to reveal her identity to the priest as well as providing a number so he could call her back at a later time once the penalty was lifted.  This goes against the complete anonimity of the Confessional.  Penitents don't have to attend Confession at their parish, they don't have to give priests' their names, and they don't even have to show their face for any other sin.  Confessional grilles exist for a reason.",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

However, if I were an American I would be concerned about the idea of so significantly reducing the number of immigrants. Most economists and demographers would tell you that, to meet its targets for  economic growth, America needs many more immigrants, what with declining birth rates, massive deportations and entry level jobs going unfilled. And the limit of 50,000 refugees for a country as big and rich as the US is pathetic, not to mention dangerous",1,"8

Residents adjacent to the proposed site were informed of the re-zoning application, and a slim majority voted against having a cemetery for a neighbour.  As for the claim that religious freedom is about freedom, do consider the recent guilty verdict for Winston Blackmore of Bountiful, B.C. He acted as if he were a bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- a church which renounced polygamy in the late 1800s. At Bountiful, the sect practised polygamy. Mr. Blackmore married 24 wives over 25 years and had 145 children. Did he collect Canada's child benefit payments for each? Did he declare 24 wives + 145 children as dependents on his tax return?  He also helped to groom young girls for obedience and marriage to selected older men on both sides of the border.

"Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.",0,"4

"OK, Outsider. In fact you do show some improvement. More than half of Caterpillar sales are foreign sales. Trump's 45% tariff on Chinese goods would certainly meet retaliation. Of course there's some doubt about the actual scope of a trade war, especially when the best example is the Smoot-Hawley tariff Act of 1930, which did indeed start a retaliatory trade war, but to what extent it caused or exacerbated the Great Depression is still debated. Most economists seem to think there would be retaliation followed by world-wide recession. Isolationism and hatred of free trade, it seems to me, are mostly irrational reactions. Outsourcing of jobs has caused a lot of pain, but many of those jobs were eliminated by efficiency gains from computer aided design and manufacture, and other forms of mechanization. Free trade has brought us affordable consumer goods, important to low wage workers. In addition, the US is ahead of low-labor nations in process efficiency. Maybe we can compete.",0,"4

"IMO this is one  of Brooks' better articles.  While he doesn't have the whole picture here he has an important piece of the puzzle.

When I leave the urban Willamette Valley, I'm often struck by the vehemence of the hostility directed towards government  and liberals by otherwise friendly, cheerful people.
And it often boils down, as Brooks suggests, to a conflict in values....while urbanites are attacked  as lazy and destructive, ruralites  defend their traditional  values (in theory if not in practice) described here as “upright, self-sufficient, energetic, adventurous, independent minded, loyal to friends and robust against foes.”  

Frankly, having grown up in Southern Oregon myself I admire  many of those values as well, but recognize the difficulty of applying them in our complex, unequal society.
Rather than deriving specifically from the Frontier, however, I'd say they're from our traditional industries of farming, fishing,   forestry, ranching and mining.",0,"4

So why the hell should anyone else care?

There is a difference between a common-or-garden American mass-shooting versus a hate-crime or act of terrorism. 

I care more if it's a hate-crime or act of terror.

A common-or-garden mass-shooting in USA is a problem due to non-existent or insane lax gun-controls and the crazy gun-culture in America more than anything else, including mental-health. These mass-shootings are inevitable in a society full of guns.

Both terrorist acts based on religion of victims - that's religious terrorism.

The Planned Parenthood shooting was extremism based on faiths that demonize Planned Parenthood. Most mass shooters are unstable, but instability doesn't choose the target in a vacuum.

The Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamic extremist, he seems to have been a bisexual man tormented by that and his faith, which like many ""Christian"" groups, demonize homosexuality.

You have to instead make raising children pay because it is valuable to society to do so.  $1000 per month per child tax credit distributed with pay.  Agree to that and you are really pro-life. No, poseur.",0,"8

Go look at the two main stories about Castro and Cuba right now (Wente's column, and the editorial page editoria).

The top-rated post for both is the post that praises Cuba, that praises Castro, that defends Trudeau, that says things that Trudeau would like to read.

That is a problem mathematically, because if you look at the thumb voting on news stories yesterday and the day before (now erased), thy were like 85 percent against Trudeau, 85 percent against Castro, 85 percent calling Castro a totalitarian thug.

"Yes, it was a better report than the Bank of Canada expected but the bottom line is still that growth under the Trudeau regime has been anemic. Even with the upward revisions to 2016Q1 and 2016Q2 growth rates the annual growth rate for 2016Q3 was 1.3%, which is simply pathetic from a leader who promised us much stronger growth than under Harper and is spending like a drunken sailor allegedly to achieve it. Dave now wonders if the 1.5% growth forecast for 2016Q4 isn’t much too pessimistic. Could be, but I’m not sure why he would think so. The Trudeau regime hasn’t strung together two quarters of solid growth yet: 2015Q4 was almost flat, and 2016Q2, even after revision, still registers the strongest quarterly drop in output since 2009Q2.",0,"4

The private sector which Wall said would take over has only taken over about a dozen routes (all with 15 passenger vans and no services for the disabled). Over 200 routes have been left unserviced. Ultimately the costs which are very low for an essential public service will be much higher -- for instance people with medical issues will simply go untreated or move to cities and so on.

Disagree that the money should go back to new Canadian home owners.  It can further exacerbate the affordability issue by subsidizing new market entrants, who could in turn increase leverage (more than they would have) and bid up prices even higher.  This appears to have been the effect from federal or provincial first-time homebuyer programs.

There is still tail risk on the Canadian mortgage market, especially if the recent Toronto correction deepens or if there is contagion.  That $4 Billion, if not held in reserves, could end up back at the CMHC as a bailout.",0,"8

One cannot preserve doctrine without cultivating its development. One also cannot tie it to a narrow and immutable interpretation, without constricting the Holy Spirit and its action. 

Tradition is a living reality, and only a limited viewpoint can imagine the “deposit of faith” as something static. One cannot put the Word of God in mothballs, as if it were an old blanket one had to preserve from vermin. No!

The NFL has strict rules in how a player can celebrate after a touchdown.  THEY GET FINED REAL $ IF THEY VIOLATE.  The NFL is free to tell them exactly how to stand for the Anthem and Flag.  
It is not 1% of players showing disrespect.  It is closer to 30% and some entire teams would not come out for the Anthem or knelt together.  Did you see the news on the London games?  NFL players knelt IN ENGLAND for the US Anthem and Flag, yet stood up for the British Anthem and Colors.  How stupid is that?  
It is my right to spend not $1 nor 1 minute on the NFL or their advertisers ever again.  That is the beauty of America and free speech.

"The hypocrisy is even deeper. The Society of St Pius X is technically considered a heretical and schismatic sect in Roman Catholic teaching due to their rejection of Vatican II. 

The fact of the matter is that the charge of heresy is sometimes abused and misused to target even the most Orthodox theologians by legalists with closed minds. St Thomas Aquinas(which might surprise people) was charged with heresy with the Condemnations of 1277 of his works. Meister Eckhart was charged with heresy over his mystical writings. Coming into the modern period Pope John XXIII as I mentioned was considered heretical by ultra traditional groups. People tend to forget that when Vatican II voted on it's documents like Gaudium et spes, Nostra Aetate and others they did not get the votes of all the bishops or clerics present. 

So the accusation of heresy against Francis that is present. When you read history carefully you see this is the same script repeating itself.",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

"The Fish and Wildlife Service should be commended for its crackdown on illegal glass eel harvesting, which may have gained a lot of recent attention but in fact has gone back many years.   It should also be noted that fishermen worked closely with the state of Maine to implement a variety of measures during the past five years to improve the integrity of this fishery.  

Not surprisingly, the American eel fishery has its fair share of detractors, whose stated goal is to end any and all harvest activities.   They have spent twenty five years making dire predictions of a rangewide stock collapse, which has simply not materialized.

Two decisions by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the past ten years have found that the American Eel species is neither endangered nor threatened with endangerment.   The public should be pleased that our state and federal regulators are working hard to find the appropriate balance between economic exploitation and conservation of this valuable resource.",0,"4

"""It is uneconomic to send Alberta bitumen to be refined in eastern Canada""

An absolute LIE.

Since Alberta oil and the pipelines that transport it are not subsidized, I guess the companies like TCPL that want to send it east, but are blockaded, must be in the business of losing money.

Now, before you claim that the oil and gas industry is subsidized, remember that not taxing an industry to death is not a subsidy. Neither are nebulous ""eco-subsidies"". 
No, a subsidy in this context is a direct grant of taxpayer $ to a company that is usually threatening to ""leave"" and throw its workers out. Think Big Auto, Bombardier and now, softwood lumber.",0,8,8,1,Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,gaussian_mixture

"I have a question; I don't know whether it has been discussed below, since I have not taken time to read all the comments.

If I understand correctly, until recently, a woman who had an abortion committed an unforgivable sin and could not be forgiven by a priest.

Yet I, as a man, as a male, could buy a gun and shoot dead 50 or 100 people. I could even murder a newborn. But, if I sincerely realized the error of my ways and was repentant,  any priest would immediately forgive me.

Am I missing something here? Is their a sexual bias in the quality of sins? Why would a woman be judged so harshly and not a man?

I am not trying to stir up controversy. I just want to know the rationale that led to this difference.

"This is a no-brainer but with all those wishy-washy Independents dabbling in the Democratic party process such basic facts are lost on many. One area of concern is Hillary's promise to tackle immigration reform in the beginning of her (eventual) administration. This sounds dubious to me as she will be unable to do anything of substance with the House in the hands of the looney Republicans.  It seems therefore that she is just playing a game where she can say, ""We tried to tackle immigration reform but it didn't work""--this would be a sell-out for all the immigrants in limbo. I hope she doesn't make mistakes like Obama did--going for healthcare reform instead of making sure that Dems drew the congressional districts by winning the mid-term elections. Dems really dropped the ball by not showing up in that mid-term election--what a bunch of idiot losers all those stay at home Dems are. Now we're f*cked until the 2020 reapportionment.",1,"8

Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”

"First on climate, this is simply a bad ""deal"" for a number of reasons most prominently that it ""commits"" the US to a high cost / low return program that secures neither US national interest or global climate interests. Secondly, apart from the voluntary nature of goals and the modest commitments by the biggest polluters; this was never even a treaty under US law (Obama never submitted it to the Senate where it would have died) - again, Obama was brilliant with putting sentiment over substance. 

You can go into all the very rational and comprehensive arguments why the treaty will not work and simply does not make sense from a risk perspective. Of course, much of the argument on the other side rests on catastrophic predictions (with a terrible track record), moral imperatives and virtue signaling mostly shared by the Davos elite. Don't get me wrong, ensuring a cleaner environment is a good thing - much is already happening without the treaty and will continue to happen without a treaty.",0,"8

In Trump's case, especially since allegations of bigotry, exploiting the alt-right movement, etc. that was part of his campaign and with Bannon included in his administration I think there is room to argue that Trump is avoiding addressing the root of the problem because doing so would likely alienate part of his base if not for more deplorable reasons.",0,"8

As for have I ""forgone a wage increase"". Yes, I did not receive an annual wage increase in 2008/2009 when there was a recession in my industry. I did not receive one in 2010 when I left to re-train by investing in a new education. I also did not receive one in 2013/2014 when a downturn happened in my new industry. You talk about annual wage increases like they're a god-given right. By all means index minimum-wage to inflation as was planned. Don't pretend that skilled workers get the same treatment as that.

And no, I won't give up $1/$2 per hour for a teenager to have a higher minimum wage. They are gaining invaluable work experience.

"First, the $1.2B would consist of $300 Million for the next three years, and $200M the 4th year.  If 25 school districts were eliminated (leaving 29), and each of those districts had only 1 superintendent at a limited pay of $100,000 annually, that would be a $2.5 Million savings.  As you are probably aware, Anchorage's Superintendent gets paid over $200,000 per year. Not to mention eliminating multiple sub-administrators at the same time we eliminate superintendents. I believe the Governor has proposed freezing non-union employee raises for three years, and he anticipated a $2.5+/- Million savings there.

"It's no surprise to me that the current system that drives CEO pay, most notably in the US, took off during the 1980s when the baby boomers were hitting their stride in their careers and looking to gain strong returns on their investments as interest rates in North America started to come down, kicking off a 30-year pattern that saw equity markets gaining favour over fixed income.   

And you can understand pay increases to a point, however, what has happened in some companies is head-scratching with pay packages that go well into the tens of millions, and sometimes into the hundrens of millions of USD.   It completely defies logic since a CEO is not an omniscient being and needs people in the company to do their jobs well, just as much, if not more, than the CEO does his/her own job.

"Hi, Bill - I think it's interesting that we've moved from the God-the-Just-Judge hermeneutic for the New Testament to a God-is-love hermeneutic that virtually ignore its predecessors. It typically does so largely on the basis of the curious letters of an unknown Presbyter who also develops the idea of God-as-Light, an idea that has not similarly captured the imagination of many westerners. So God is love and anything goes.
Correct me if I'm wrong but one of the main contributions of the Reformation Churches was to put one's personal decision for (or against) the Gospel back at the center of Christian faith and practice, restoring a balance that had been lost in the Roman Church.
So my question is: do you think we're moving too far away from that Reformation message and toward a God-is-love message that validates just about anything as long as we say we ""love"" one another ?  I would love to have this discussion at some point, if anyone is interested. - Monica.",0,"8

When Home Capital goes down, it just looks a bit different - no CMHC payout, but CDIC has to step in, at least to the tune of ensuring $100k per account.

My ""favorite"" (said sarcastically) is Park Place Olde Town, where a historic building was bulldozed, and a city owned piece of property was sold to the developer for $10.  Meanwhile, the city was changing the zoning for Olde Town, and let the architect and developer tell them exactly how high the height limits needed to be to accommodate their five story, modern building.  Previously, two stories was the maximum height.  This building now sits like a sore thumb in the midst of three National Historic Districts.  What a travesty!",0,"8

"Once again Primacy of conscience demands that Catholics stand up, in Catholic Churches, as Catholics, against any church rule that demands we break the dogma which is higher than all other dogmas because the church agrees the Great Commandment is a dogma and of Christ.

This doctrine banning women's equal ordination breaks the above dogmatic commandment of Christ.  This would not be the first time a doctrine or tradition was deemed incorrect theology and therefor was changed in Roman Catholicism's history.  So it is not in-Catholic to demand the church stop abusing the human dignity of all its women by keeping one of he most important sacraments from them for no justifiable cause in Christ.  This does not make us protestant it just makes us more a church which adheres to the Gospel Commandments of Christ as we should have always done.

Some including myself would argue that our current government is far too preoccupied with symbolism at the expense of substance, with fantasy stuff for the gullible base at the expense of real leadership on tangible things that actually matter.

It must also be said that the US has made remarkable progress over the past 15 years going from by far the biggest carbon emitter (about 35% of the world's FFEs) to a distant 2nd (19%) and falling to China (30%) and rising.

This was accomplished by market sector innovations and public sector initiatives at all levels and is worthy of praise not condemnation.

As more facts have emerged it is clear this entire incident was created by a politically active mother with an agenda. Yeah, sure lady, your 11 year old son dug up the obscure testimony from 2013 and then carefully phrased that question. Then Mommy covertly videoed her son asking the question. I am sure the other parents in the Scout Den were thrilled at the chance to rid themselves of this mother. 

I don't care for Vicki Marble or her viewpoints on most issues, but she is dead on when she says this was a setup which Democrats are seeking to exploit.

The funding model provides an unfair advantage to the incumbent government and disadvantages any new party that did not previously participate in the previous election (Pure Chretien).

The current model of providing a decreasing tax credit for personal contributions levels the playing field for the middle class donors.  The rich will donate the maximum regardless.  The tax credit makes donating more attractive to people who don't donate the maximum and instead make small contributions (say $10-20 per month) based on what they can afford.

"Pathetic Liberals. Why are gay Chechen's a top priority for Canada's government? Why do they have to be spirited away in secret? Such utter BS to claim: ""it is for their safety"". No, it is self-serving of these special interests groups. What value do they add to Canada? These individuals do not represent the value of average Canadian's, or their first priority.  Gays should stop deluding themselves into thinking that the average Canadian really cares about gay rights. They don't. Do they care about heterosexual rights? No, didn't think so.
Second, John Ibbistson should not be writing a piece promoting gay refugees over others without disclosing he himself is gay. Full disclosure John. Enough is enough. There are far more needy people out in the world that need Canada's help then homosexuals from a far off country. Take care of your own first, then those in real need, then if you want to save some special interest group, go ahead. But that isn't the Liberal way, it's the Trudeau way.",1,"8

Thus he's willing to risk losing some BC support rather than raise ire of Quebeckers by approving an expanded Energy East pipeline through Quebec instead ( a project very unpopular with Quebeckers). Trudeau feels it's more important to gain rather than lose seats in Quebec over pipelines. . Better to sacrifice BC seats to save Quebec politically for Liberals.

"A timely and well-written article.  Fundamentalist Christianity has always been a factor in right wing politics in the US, and while the creep factor is not as high as it is with a man like Bannon, is still something those not blindly aligned with the faith should be concerned about.

It strikes me as somewhat hypocritical that the far right rails against Islam as a force that could destroy the fabric of Western society.  While true that our society is largely founded on Judeo-Christian tradition, the views of Mr Graham are repugnant to many and pose a threat to our way of living.

In many cases, they should also be repugnant to those that embrace our spiritual heritage.  Love of enemies?    Forgiveness? Curiously absent.

When radical Muslims twist the teachings of their faith to justify abhorrent words and deeds, we vilify them.  Graham may not be guilty of abhorrent deeds but his words to the more tolerant among us are anathema.",1,"4
